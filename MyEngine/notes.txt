Ideas for lighting system:

Could have a maximum "dynamic", or shadow casting lights per chunk. That is, a limit on the number of lights
other block march towards for their light value. After that, aditional lights project their light onto their sarrounding
blocks directly as they are placed to limit the complexity of recalculations
